# Automated-Binary-Exploitation
Program that recommends and automatically exploits binaries using buffer overflow and other methods.

To use: 
1. I tested and ran this in Vscode with a terminal below my code. First, split the terminal and in one of the terminals, call the command ```tmux```. This will let you run and log using GDB. 
2. Run environment.sh ```bash environment.sh``` to configure the environment and create the vulnerable binaries for testing. 
3.  (optional) Checksec comes with this repository, but you can redownload checksec by running ```checksec.sh```.
4.  Run ```bash exploit.bash <binary_name>``` to try it out!
5.  In configuring the environment, ASLR was deactivated. To turn it back on for your system, run ```bash aslr_on.sh```
